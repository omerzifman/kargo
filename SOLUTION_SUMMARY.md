# ✅ GitHub Actions Solution Summary

## Problem Statement
**"How can I make the actions run?"**

## Solution Provided

I've implemented a comprehensive solution to help users understand and troubleshoot GitHub Actions in the Kargo repository:

### 📁 Files Created/Modified

1. **📖 Comprehensive Documentation**
   - `docs/docs/60-contributor-guide/25-github-actions.md` - Detailed guide covering all aspects of GitHub Actions
   - `GITHUB_ACTIONS_HELP.md` - Quick reference guide for common issues

2. **🔧 Troubleshooting Tools**
   - `hack/troubleshoot-actions.sh` - Interactive diagnostic script
   - `Makefile` - Added `make hack-troubleshoot-actions` target

3. **⚙️ Enhanced Workflow**
   - `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` - Added manual trigger support with configurable options

### 🚀 Key Features

#### Automatic Triggers
Actions run automatically on:
- ✅ Pull requests (any branch except `newdocs`)
- ✅ Pushes to `main` branch
- ✅ Pushes to `release-*` branches
- ✅ Merge group events

#### Manual Triggers
Users can now manually trigger CI with:
```bash
# Via GitHub CLI
gh workflow run ci.yaml

# Via web interface: Actions → CI → Run workflow
```

#### Smart Conditional Execution
Manual triggers include options to:
- ✅ Run/skip unit tests
- ✅ Run/skip linting checks

#### Troubleshooting Script
```bash
make hack-troubleshoot-actions
```
Checks:
- ✅ Repository configuration
- ✅ Local development environment
- ✅ Network connectivity
- ✅ GitHub CLI setup
- ✅ Provides actionable recommendations

### 📋 Quick Solutions for Common Issues

1. **Actions not running at all**
   ```bash
   # Check repository settings
   make hack-troubleshoot-actions
   
   # Create a PR to trigger actions
   git checkout -b my-feature
   git push origin my-feature
   gh pr create
   ```

2. **Want to trigger manually**
   ```bash
   gh workflow run ci.yaml
   # Or use GitHub web interface
   ```

3. **Actions failing**
   ```bash
   # Test locally first
   make hack-test-unit
   make hack-lint
   make hack-codegen
   ```
